# Hey, I'm Erik 👋

I'm continually learning, building, and experimenting with AI-powered apps and tools, mostly through vibe coding with **Claude Code**, **Codex**, and **OpenClaw**, and other tools. I recently got into 3D printing with a Bambu Lab P1S my daughter got for Christmas.  All updates on this profile are my own, not part of any other company I work with.
